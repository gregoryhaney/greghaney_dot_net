UPDATE (20211208) - I am no longer a Technical Trainer with AWS, thus the live webpage has been taken down.
     I am changing career paths to full-stack developer, so during my learning, I expect to be using the domain
     for various webpages over the next several months. Once I've finished my initial learning and have secured
     a job, I plan to update this domain with an actively-maintained, robust, relevant-to-me website.


# greghaney_dot_net
Website for greghaney.net - AWS Technical Trainer site Dec 2020
This repo contains the CSS, HTML, and JS files for the 'greghaney.net' webpage.
The website is my professional AWS Trainer site that I provide as a courtesy to my students.
In addition to the website files, the content is also included (images and documents).

As I become certified on additional courses with AWS, the webpage will be updated to reflect and
additional documents will be added for download by student visitors to the site.
