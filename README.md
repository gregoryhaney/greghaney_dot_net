# greghaney_dot_net
Website for greghaney.net - AWS Technical Trainer site Dec 2020
This repo contains the CSS, HTML, and JS files for the 'greghaney.net' webpage.
The website is my professional AWS Trainer site that I provide as a courtesy to my students.
In addition to the website files, the content is also included (images and documents).

As I become certified on additional courses with AWS, the webpage will be updated to reflect and
additional documents will be added for download by student visitors to the site.
